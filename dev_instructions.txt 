Django rest Framework Notes: 

APIView allow us to define functions that match standard HTTP methods
like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.

Viewsets allow us to define functions that match to common API object 
actions like : LIST, CREATE, RETRIEVE, UPDATE, etc.

Viewsets are also used to write logic to perform standard database 
operations and to interface with a database back-end. And are usually 
used for existing database model to manage predefined objects.
